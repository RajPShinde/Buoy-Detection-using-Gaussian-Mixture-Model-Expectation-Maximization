## Overview
A code to perform segmentation of colours, in an underwater scene consisting of three buoy's, viz. Yellow, Orange and Green. The Implementation uses the Expectation Maximization algorithm to obtain the best Gaussian Model for segmenation of colours.

## Dependencies
1. Ubuntu 18.04
2. python 3.8.1
3. OpenCV 3.4.9

## Run
Type the following commands in the Terminal
For Yellow Buoy detection
```
python Yellow_Detection.py
```
For Orange Buoy detection
```
python Orange_Detection.py
```
For Green Buoy detection
```
python Green_Detection.py
```
